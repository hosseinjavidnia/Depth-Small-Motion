# Accurate Depth Map Estimation From Small Motions
This repository contains the code for the method presented in the following paper:

**H. Javidnia and P. Corcoran, “Accurate Depth Map Estimation From Small Motions,” in Proceedings of the IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (ICCV), Venice, Italy, 2017, pp. 2453–2461. doi: 10.1109/ICCVW.2017.289**

The code is written and compiled in MATLAB R2017a x64. The MEX files are also compiled in x64 environment.
To run the code please follow these instructions:

1. Download the repository.
2. Run the "Run.m" file in MATLAB.

There is one video sample on Dataset folder. This version of the code accepts only videos with 30 frames as the input. The additional motion clips are available at [SfSM](https://goo.gl/m5QohE).
The input motion clips has to be placed in the Dataset folder. You can modify the "Run.m" file to process another video.
The results will be saved in "Result" folder.
